# Odyssey: animals on the island's ground (2026-11-01)

Nothing living walked on the island in chapters 3-5. Now a small herd of red deer grazes the glade
on the rise above the chapter-3 shore: three hinds, a yearling and a calf at its mother's side.

![Before and after, at L11, L14, L15 and L17](images/odyssey-animals-2026-11-01/before-after.jpg)

Left: before (`?odysseyNoDeer=1`). Right: after. Rows, top to bottom: L11, L14, L15, L17 (crops of
1600x900 shots, enlarged 2.5x).

## Choosing the place (the scouting numbers)

The rail camera flies high over the island: 63-172 m above the ground under it in chapters 3-4, and
170-350 m from L27 on. So the nearest open ground it ever sees is 120-200 m away, and always in the
lower part of the frame. Measured on the real rail camera with the real terrain and both forest tiers
(`tests/unit/helpers/odyssey-camera-rig.js`, `odysseyWorldHeight`, the forest scatter):

| Candidate | Seen from | Distance | Withers height at 1440p, 1x / 2x / 3x |
|---|---|---|---|
| Red deer, the glade above the chapter-3 shore | L11-L15 without a break, L17 | 120-240 m | 8-17 / 16-34 / 24-51 px |
| Red deer, the open ground at the massif's foot (z -430..-470) | only the L17-L19 glide, at the frame's bottom edge | 160-210 m | 6-11 / 12-22 / 18-33 px |
| Ibex on the massif's wall (L22-L26) | L22-L26, bottom edge of the frame | 130-170 m | 10-15 / 20-30 / 30-45 px (for a 1.3 m animal) |
| Ibex or chamois on the climb (L27-L28) | L27 only | 190-330 m | 5-9 / 10-18 / 15-27 px |

(The first row is the hind's withers, 1.16 m; the others are for a 1.3 m-shoulder animal.) The glade
wins: it is in view the longest (five
orbs, from the breach to L15, then again at L17), it is open grass on a gentle slope (under 0.4), it
faces the camera as the camera comes in from the sea, and the sun is behind the camera's shoulder.
The climb was ruled out: from L26 on the camera rises away from the rock, so ibex there would be
specks.

The deer are drawn at three times life, like the act's other life (the gulls, the butterflies). Their
withers are then 24-27 px tall at 1440p from the sea-side parks (L11-L14), 40 px at L15 and 51 px
at L17. From the sea some of them stand behind trees; at L15 and L17 most of the herd shows.

## The model

`scripts/blender/odyssey/red_deer.py`, headless Blender, rebuilds `assets/chapter-03/deer/red-deer.glb`
byte for byte. A red deer hind at real size: 1.16 m at the withers, built from rounded shapes,
1,786 triangles (1,798 after the polish below), skinned to 25 bones (spine, neck, head, ears,
four-bone legs, tail). The legs are a little thicker than life so they stay solid lines when drawn
small. The coat is painted into the vertex colours: red-brown body, greyer neck and legs, a pale
rump patch and belly, dark hooves and nose.

![The model's poses: alert, grazing, walking, looking round](images/odyssey-animals-2026-11-01/model-poses.jpg)

## Their life

- Every deer has its own clock (a seeded schedule that repeats every ~5 minutes). Their places come
  from the clock alone; the camera passes them.
- A hind keeps to her own two or three spots in the glade. She grazes with her head down, takes a
  step or two between bites, lifts her head to look round now and then, and every minute and a half
  or so walks a few paces to her next spot (turning on the spot first).
- The calf stays at its mother's flank, a quarter of a second behind her.
- The walk is a four-beat walk whose rhythm follows the distance walked, so the hooves do not slide.
- Feet on the ground: the body tilts with the slope, the legs hang plumb, the body is set down until
  its highest standing hoof touches the ground, and every other standing leg bends just enough to
  bring its hoof onto the ground too. The tests measure the result: standing hooves within 14 cm of
  the ground on a 3x hind (under half a pixel at these distances), and no hoof ever digs in.

![Six frames, 1.5 s apart, at L17: the hind grazes and steps, the calf beside her](images/odyssey-animals-2026-11-01/motion-l17.jpg)

## Light and shadow

The act's light: the world's low sun, the sky from above (softened toward warm air so a red coat in
shade stays brown, not purple), the green of the meadow from below, a little sky on the outline,
and the air between them and the eye. A soft shadow lies under each deer on the slope.

## No popping, no hitch

- They are drawn from p 0.08 (deep in chapter 2, under the sea) to p 0.26 (after L17, when the glade
  has left the frame). The test checks that the eye is far under water at the start and that every
  deer is out of the frame at the end, at every clock phase.
- The eagle's lifecycle: the model is fetched as chapter 2 begins, compiled while the board is idle,
  and only then drawn. If it fails to load, the island is exactly as it was.
- Turn it off with `?odysseyNoDeer=1`.

## Cost

- 2 draws: the whole herd is one instanced draw (5 x 1,786 = 8,930 triangles), plus one draw of 5
  soft shadows.
- Posing the herd costs about 0.05 ms a frame on the CPU; a 17 KB table goes to the GPU each frame.
- No new pipelines after the first compile.

## Tests

`tests/unit/odyssey-ground-animals.test.js`: the model and its skin; both shader backends (WGSL and
GLSL) build cleanly; hidden until ready; every deer on dry grass under 0.45 slope, clear of trunks
and low crowns in both forest tiers; hooves on the ground; the deer keep apart; a grazing muzzle
reaches the grass; the herd in view at L11-L17 with the pixel sizes above; never appearing or
leaving in view.

## Left for later

- A stag (antlers would be one or two pixels thick at this size and would flicker).
- Ibex on the massif: only worth it if the camera ever comes close to the rock.

## Polish (2026-11-01 evening)

The owner, up close: "The deer's head looks a bit horse-like. A slimmer muzzle, bigger ears and the
pale rump patch would fix it." Changed in the Blender builder (the rebuild is still byte for byte):

- **The head** is a deer's wedge now, not a horse's box: 0.34 m from the poll to the nose instead of
  0.40, deep at the cheek and the eye and narrowing to a fine nose, with a forehead and brows over
  large eyes (the eye line). It is a little smaller against the neck (the top of the neck is a touch
  thicker).
- **The ears** are bigger broad ovals with a rounded tip (21.5 cm long, 11 cm wide), set high on the
  poll and angled well out to the sides.
- **The rump patch**: everything on the buttocks that faces back, from just above the tail down toward
  the hocks, is a pale cream, with a slightly darker edge round its top and sides; the short tail on
  it is cream with a thin dark stripe along its top. A pale chin too. In the game the pale is creamier
  than before (it was a tan).
- Because the face is shorter, the grazing pose swings the neck a little lower (so the muzzle still
  reaches the grass); everything else (rig, weights, poses, herd, places) is as it was.
- 1,798 triangles (was 1,786). All the deer tests pass unchanged (hooves, places, sizes, no pop).
- Not done: spots on the calf. By September a red deer calf has mostly lost them, and at 15-25 px
  they would only read as noise.

In the game, before (left) and after (right), the same moments (the clock pinned): L17 three times,
then L15 (2560x1440, crops enlarged 2x):

![In the game, before and after](images/odyssey-animals-2026-11-01/polish-game-before-after.jpg)

Closer (L17, enlarged 4x): the rump patch now shows round the tail, the heads are finer.

### The orb card and the herd (lead, 2026-11-01 evening)

Checked with the screen as the owner sees it: 2560x1600 at 150 %, Odyssey started the way a click
starts it, the map reached with its Map button, the UI left on.
- The orb card sits on the right of the screen. On the rail at orb 15 the herd is at the lower left;
  at orb 17 it is near the bottom middle. The card never covers it.
- After clicking orb 15 or 17, the camera frames the orb close-up and the herd is out of frame to the
  left, so nothing covers it there either.

![The rail at orb 15 and orb 17 with the UI on: the card on the right, the herd lower left and bottom middle](images/odyssey-animals-2026-11-01/orb-card-l15-l17.jpg)

## GPU timing (lead, 2026-11-01 evening)

Timed with the birds, deer and fish together on the RTX at full speed (2560x1440, High, two rounds,
main against this work at the same stations: p 0.095 and 0.11 the fish, 0.168, 0.194 and 0.22 the
deer, gulls and swallows, 0.31 the swallows and geese, 0.62 the summit kettle). GPU time per frame
was within 0.07 ms of main at every station (for example 2.10 ms both at L15, 1.18 against 1.11-1.18
ms at the kettle), so the new animals cost nothing measurable there.

## Design and motion pass (2026-11-02)

The owner: "We really need to improve the look and design and animation and movement of the deer! I
want it to move in a more natural and smooth way when eating, walking, turning, looking etc."

### The audit (before)

Watched at game size (30 fps clips at L15 and L17 with the board clock pinned, so the same moments
can be compared) and measured on the game's own CPU twin of the herd over every deer's whole loop:

1. **Hooves slid while bearing weight.** The legs were swung by angles, not planted: a standing hoof
   moved up to 0.7-1.3 of the deer's drawn size over a stance (2-4 m on a 3x hind), most at the
   start and end of every walk.
2. **Pops.** A leg fix-up that switched on and off made joints jump: 285-744 frames a loop where a
   joint turned faster than 6 rad/s, the hooves up to 41 rad/s in single frames.
3. **Turning on the spot like a turntable.** 10-17 s a loop of the body turning while hardly
   moving, up to 4.3 rad/s; at L15 a hind spun about 180 degrees in place before walking off (top row
   of the L15 image below).
4. **The calf** hung at a fixed place beside its mother and was swung round her when she turned, at
   up to 12 m/s.
5. **A hinge for a neck.** Two neck bones: the head went down to graze and came up like a lever; no
   jaw, no breathing; grazing was a held pose with a small nod; ears and tail barely moved.
6. **The body.** Thick legs (to stay visible), a straight barrel with no waist, small eyes, little
   shading on the coat.

What a red deer does (and what the new motion follows): a four-beat walk, the hooves lifting left
hind, left fore, right hind, right fore, each on the ground about 60 % of the stride and planted
while it bears weight; the head nods with the fore feet; it turns by walking a curve with the body
following the head, or, for a sharp turn, by stepping the forehand round its hind legs; the head goes
down to graze over a second or two, crops in small nods and sways and chews; it looks up ears first,
then the head, then the neck; the tail and ears flick.

### What changed

**The model** (`scripts/blender/odyssey/red_deer.py`, still rebuilt byte for byte): 27 bones (three
neck bones and a jaw), a deeper chest, a tucked-up waist, rounder quarters, longer, slimmer legs with
clearer knees and hocks, larger eyes in a dark rim, a darker back line, a paler belly and darker lower
legs. 2,098 triangles (was 1,798). The neck's root blends into the chest over a longer band so the
bend down to graze is a curve over the withers.

![The model before (top) and after (bottom): side, three-quarter front, behind, the head](images/odyssey-animals-2026-11-02/model-before-after.jpg)

**The motion** (`composition/odyssey-deer-herd.js`, rewritten). Procedural, not baked Blender
cycles: the deer walk on a sloping glade along curves of any length and turn by any angle, so baked
cycles would have to be stretched, blended and corrected for the ground anyway (that is where foot
sliding comes from). Instead:
- **Paths.** Walks are curves that leave the way the deer faces, with a smooth start and stop (no
  instant start or stop); a turn too sharp for a curve is first made on the spot by pivoting round the
  hind legs, never faster than 0.7 rad/s. Grazing steps are short, slow curves.
- **Feet.** A footstep planner walks each deer through its loop once when the herd loads (about 10 ms
  a deer, one deer per task so it never holds a frame) and records every hoof's steps. While the deer
  moves, the hooves lift in the four-beat order as the ground goes by (shorter, quicker steps when
  it moves slowly); where each one lands is where it should stand half a stance later; when it stops,
  the hooves settle under it with a step or two. A planted hoof never moves.
- **Legs** reach their hooves with a two-segment solve each (the knees fold back, the hocks forward,
  each never past about 110 degrees), the hoof flat on the ground while planted and flicked back in
  the swing.
- **Body** rides on the feet: height, pitch and roll from the ground under them, carried a little
  lower in a walk, hips and shoulders rolling with each step, breathing, a slow shift of weight while
  it stands.
- **Head and neck** move through the three neck bones; every change (head down to graze, up to look)
  is eased over 1-2 s on a curve that cannot jump, however short the segments. Grazing crops with
  small nods and sways and the jaw chews; it chews the cud now and then with the head up. A look turns
  the ears first, then the head, then the neck down its length. Ears swivel and flick, the tail
  flicks.
- The calf has its own spots next to its mother's (a fixed slot at her side swung it round her).

In the game, before (top row) and after (bottom row), one frame a second, the same moments of the
board clock (2560x1440, crops enlarged):

### Numbers (after, every deer's whole loop at 30 fps)

| | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| A weight-bearing hoof's slide (share of the drawn size) | 0.7-1.3 | under 0.05 in 99 % of frames, 0.16 at worst |
| Fastest leg joint | 38-41 rad/s (pops) | 10-14 rad/s (a walk's swing) |
| Fastest spine, neck or head joint | (part of the pops) | about 3 rad/s (the head going down to graze) |
| Turning on the spot | up to 4.3 rad/s, spun | at most 0.64 rad/s, stepped round |
| Turning in a walk | | at most 0.23 rad/s (curves) |
| Body acceleration | | at most 2.7 m/s^2 |
| Walk order kept | | 89-100 % of lifts |
| CPU per frame (whole herd) | ~0.05 ms | ~0.03 ms |

Still two draws (5 x 2,098 = 10,490 triangles plus the shadows), no new pipelines after the first
compile, the same places, sizes and no-pop windows, `?odysseyNoDeer=1` as before. New tests in
`tests/unit/odyssey-ground-animals.test.js`: no hoof slides, every joint smooth through every change
of state, smooth starts and stops, turns walked or stepped round (never spun), the four-beat order,
the loop's seam, walks leaving the way the deer faces.
